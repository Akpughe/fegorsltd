About Fegors
Cleaning Spaces. Supporting Lives.
Fegors was founded on a simple belief:
clean spaces improve wellbeing, productivity, and community life.
We started as a small local team cleaning homes and community spaces across Edinburgh.
Over time, our work and reputation grew, leading us to support major organisations and
construction developers — while still caring deeply about everyday families and local residents.

We are proud to serve both individual clients and commercial partners who value quality, trust,

Sustainability & Eco-Friendly Cleaning
Supporting Cleaner Spaces, Healthier Lives & a Greener Future
At Fegors, sustainability is not a marketing
slogan — it's a practical commitment.
We clean in ways that protect people, respect
the environment, and support the UK's
broader mission toward a Net Zero future.

We believe every cleaning decision — from
detergents to equipment to daily habits — can
contribute to a healthier society.
Our Eco-Friendly Philosophy
1. Low-Chemical Cleaning Where Possible
We prioritise gentler, non-harsh products and
modern water-based cleaning technology.
This reduces chemical exposure in:
● Homes
● Student accommodations
● Offices
● Shared community spaces

It's safer for families, allergy sufferers, and
workplace environments.
2. Supporting UK Net Zero Goals
The UK aims to reach Net Zero emissions by
2050, and we believe service providers have
a role to play.
Our contribution includes:
● Reducing chemical waste
● Minimising plastic use
● Efficient, water-based floor cleaning
● Extending the lifespan of surfaces and
floors

● Supporting clients with greener cleaning
plans
We adapt our methods continuously to stay
aligned with government environmental
direction.
3. SDG-Aligned Daily Practices
While we are not certified, our work naturally
supports key United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) that relate to
health, safety, and sustainable living:
● SDG 3 – Good Health & Wellbeing:
Cleaner indoor air quality, reduced
allergies, gentler cleaning choices.
● SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities &
Communities:

Healthier living spaces, cleaner student
accommodations, safer shared facilities.
● SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption &
Production:
Reduced chemical usage and
water-saving cleaning processes.
We contribute in a practical, everyday way —
not through complex pledges, but through
consistent action.
4. Waste Awareness & Responsible Disposal
For both homes and commercial clients, we
ensure:
● Proper rubbish sorting

● Reduced plastic liner usage where
possible
● Safe, correct disposal of cleaning waste
● Encouraging recycling practices
Small habits create lasting impact across
workplaces and communities.
5. Healthier Indoor Environments
A clean space should feel refreshing, not
chemical-heavy.
Our methods aim to create:
● Fresher air
● Safer breathing spaces

● Cleaner surfaces without irritation
● A better experience for staff, students,
and families
This is especially important in offices,
child-friendly homes, and accommodation
blocks.
